Full-Stack MLFlow Weather Prediction App
This project implements a full-stack weather prediction application using MLFlow for model versioning, DVC (Data Version Control) for dataset management, and MLOps practices for workflow automation. The application integrates a trained weather prediction model with a web frontend, backend API, and a database for user authentication.

Project Overview
This repository includes the following components:

MLFlow Integration for versioning, logging metrics, and registering models in the model registry.
Full-Stack Web Application for predicting temperature based on weather data inputs.
REST API built with Flask/FastAPI to serve the model predictions.
User Authentication using a database (SQLite/MySQL/MongoDB).
CI/CD Pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
Kubernetes Deployment using Minikube.
Project Features
1. MLFlow Versioning and Model Registry
Versioning of models during training.
Logging of key metrics and parameters during model training.
Model registration in MLFlow's Model Registry with staging and production stages for model management.
2. Full-Stack Application
Frontend
A user-friendly interface that allows users to input weather features and get temperature predictions.
Built using a framework of your choice (e.g., React, Angular, or simple HTML/JS).
Backend
A REST API developed using Flask or FastAPI that integrates with the trained model to serve predictions.
Database
User Authentication: Implemented with a database (SQLite, MySQL, or MongoDB) to manage user signup, login, and session management.
3. Branch-Based Workflow
Dev Branch: Active development and feature updates.
Testing Branch: Automated testing workflow and integration.
Prod Branch: Final deployment, triggered by CI/CD pipelines.
CI/CD Workflow
Dev → Testing: Trigger a CI pipeline on commits to testing. This includes running unit tests and building Docker images.
Testing → Prod: Upon merging to prod, trigger a CD pipeline that deploys the app using Minikube and pulls the Docker image from DockerHub.
4. Blog Post
A technical blog post is available to showcase the full implementation, explaining MLOps practices, DVC, and MLFlow integration, automated workflows, and model monitoring.


Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction-app.git
cd weather-prediction-app

2. Backend Setup
Install dependencies:
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

Set up the backend REST API using Flask or FastAPI:
cd backend
python app.py

3. Frontend Setup
Install frontend dependencies (e.g., React):
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

4. Database Setup
Set up user authentication using SQLite, MySQL, or MongoDB.
Example for SQLite:
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade

5. MLFlow Integration
To log metrics and models with MLFlow, make sure to initialize MLFlow in your model training scripts.
import mlflow
mlflow.start_run()
mlflow.log_param("param_name", value)
mlflow.log_metric("metric_name", value)
mlflow.log_artifact("model.pkl")
